Living in Czech republic? You can vote! European Union citizens with the residence in the Czech Republic are eligible to vote in the upcoming local elections. However a necessary step you need to perform to be able to vote is the registration for the local elections with the Office of the municipality where you are registered as a *resident*.

There is however a discussion whether the residency needs to be permanent or if temporary residents are allowed to vote as well. So far the interpretation has been leaning towards giving the right to vote to permanent residents only, however a recent court ruling (September 19, 2014) suggests that even temporary residents can vote. So, if you’re not a permanent resident, you can try getting registered (see below), but it’s uncertain that your municipality will allow that. Permanent residents are unaffected and can vote regardless.

The deadline for registrations is August 26, 2018. You will need to present your passport and a document proving that you are the resident of the municipality. Although the application itself needs to be in Czech, we included instructions in brackets. You can [download this PDF](https://jihomoravsky.pirati.cz/assets/pdf/voting-application.pdf) file to print the form.

Pirates wish you good luck with your choice!
