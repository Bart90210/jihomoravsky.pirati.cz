      I'm possibly the only comic book character who didn't make his sad life story to gain sympathy from the audience. I did it by getting shot in the asshole. You need more words? Here you go: Fuck, balls, ass, dick, tits! I believe all my enemies can fly, that's why I throw them in the air. If an ugly fuck like me can get his girl to still him, you can also find love. Just kidding! the real world is a cruel place. I'm a smart ass with a great ass. Beat that Superman. I'm a smart ass with a great ass. Beat that Superman. Lorem ipsum is officially my bitch!

      It’s not that I hate wolverine, it’s just that If we’re both in a desert and I have a glass of water, I’m going to drink it and pee on his bitch face. I'm a smart ass with a great ass. Beat that Superman. Roses are red. Violets are blue. Fuck you Francis!!! I'm like a red kawaii ninja with a great ass. If your gf/bf hated you for watching deadpool instead of doing something special, I'm glad you dumped them. If an ugly fuck like me can get his girl to still him, you can also find love. Just kidding! the real world is a cruel place. I'm possibly the only comic book character who didn't make his sad life story to gain sympathy from the audience.

      I'm a smart ass with a great ass. Beat that Superman. Lorem ipsum is officially my bitch! In the next movie, you'll be seeing Deadpool fighting the police for the last chocolate donut. It’s not that I hate wolverine, it’s just that If we’re both in a desert and I have a glass of water, I’m going to drink it and pee on his bitch face. Due to many complaints about a white man not being portrayed as a villian, we put a fucking British guy instead. Somebody forgot to put a black guy here...oops. Is that a bird? Is that a plane? No it's a douchebag who wears his undies over his pants!

Sure I sucked in the previous X men movie, but hey I didn't produce that. Loki and I would be great friends. If he stopped trying to take over the world to get his daddy’s attention. I know my costume looks really familiar to spidey's but he can only spray out sticky liquid with his hands and cry. Sure I sucked in the previous X men movie, but hey I didn't produce that.
